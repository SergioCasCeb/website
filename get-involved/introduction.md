# Get Involved

:::info

For the moment the Get Involved page is still under construction. For more information about Thingweb Community refer to our social media accounts located in the website footer.

:::

There are various ways to get involved via GitHub : https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb

You can pick one of the Eclipse Thingweb components such as [node-wot](https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb/node-wot) or [playground](https://playground.thingweb.io) and start using them. Even better, you can contribute to their source code! Below are some examples of what you can contribute with:

* node-wot: Create and contribute your own protocols bindings besides HTTP, CoAP, Websockets, ...
* playground: Add tools that take Thing Descriptions and generate developer tooling for other systems
* All components: Report any issue you encounter (and even better, provide a fix)

## Licenses

All Thingweb components are licensed with [Eclipse Public License v. 2.0](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/) and [W3C Software Notice and Document License (2015-05-13)](https://www.w3.org/copyright/software-license-2015/). You can pick the one that suits your requirements (i.e. you only have to comply with one, not both).
